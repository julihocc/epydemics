### 3. Global COVID-19 Forecasting
**File:** `notebooks/03_global_covid19_forecasting.ipynb`

Advanced research notebook demonstrating adaptive forecasting methodology using time-varying SIRD model parameters. Reproduces results from "Adaptive Epidemic Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning" (Castillo Colmenares, 2024).

**Features:**
- Global COVID-19 data analysis
- Advanced VAR model selection (AIC criterion)
- Multi-wave pandemic capture
- R₀(t) calculation and interpretation
- Professional visualization techniques
- Comprehensive model evaluation

**Expected runtime:** 8-12 minutes  
**Dataset:** Global COVID-19 data (OWID_WRL)

**Key results:**
- Confirmed cases forecast: MAPE = 4.27%
- Infected population forecast: MAPE = 25.98%
- Successfully captures multiple pandemic waves

---

### 4. Parallel Simulations Demo
**File:** `notebooks/04_parallel_simulations.ipynb`

Performance optimization using parallel execution.

**Topics:**
- Sequential vs parallel simulation comparison
- Multi-core execution with `n_jobs` parameter
- Performance benchmarking
- Speedup analysis (4-7x improvement)
- Memory usage considerations
- Best practices for large-scale simulations

**Expected runtime:** 5-10 minutes  
**Recommendation:** Use for SIRDV models (81 scenarios)

---

### 5. Multi-Backend Comparison
**File:** `notebooks/05_multi_backend_comparison.ipynb`

Comparison of different time series backends (VAR, ARIMA, Prophet).

**Topics:**
- Multiple forecasting backends
- Performance comparison
- Backend selection guidance
- Trade-offs between complexity and accuracy

**Expected runtime:** 10-15 minutes (if optional backends installed)

---

### 6. Annual Measles Data Workaround
**File:** `notebooks/06_annual_measles_workaround.ipynb`

Complete guide to working with annual surveillance data using Phase 1 workarounds.

**Topics:**
- Annual frequency detection and warnings
- Understanding reindexing limitations
- Temporal aggregation workflow
- Converting daily forecasts to annual output
- Comparison with COVID-19 workflow
- Preview of v0.9.0 native support
- USA measles simulation (1980-2020)

**Expected runtime:** 5-7 minutes  
**Data type:** Annual surveillance data  
**Status:** Phase 1 workaround (superseded by v0.9.0 incidence mode)

**Key workflow:**
1. Load annual data (40 years)
2. Suppress frequency warnings
3. Forecast in daily resolution (internal)
4. Aggregate back to annual output

**Limitations:**
- Not production-ready for critical decisions
- Suitable for exploratory analysis
- Requires temporal aggregation for meaningful results

### 7. Incidence Mode: Measles Analysis ⭐ NEW in v0.9.0
**File:** `notebooks/07_incidence_mode_measles.ipynb`

**Native incidence mode support** for diseases where incident (not cumulative) cases are reported.

**Topics:**
- Understanding incidence vs cumulative data
- Using `mode='incidence'` parameter
- DataContainer automatic processing (C from I)
- Model workflow (no changes needed!)
- Forecasting sporadic outbreak patterns
- Comparing incidence vs cumulative mode
- Mexico measles case study (2010-2024)

**Expected runtime:** 4-6 minutes  
**Model type:** SIRD with incidence mode  
**Data pattern:** Elimination/reintroduction cycles

**Key Features:**
- **I column**: Incident cases per period (can vary up/down)
- **C column**: Auto-generated via cumsum (monotonic)
- **No workarounds**: Native support, production-ready
- **Use cases**: Measles, polio, vaccine-preventable diseases

**When to use:**
- ✅ Annual/quarterly surveillance data
- ✅ Incident cases can decrease (elimination achieved)
- ✅ Diseases with near-elimination status
- ❌ Not needed for cumulative reporting (COVID-19, etc.)

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install dynasir with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or install from PyPI
pip install dynasir

# Install jupyter for running notebooks
pip install jupyter
```

### Launch Jupyter
```bash
cd examples
jupyter notebook
```

Then open any `.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface.

### Running from Command Line
```bash
# Convert notebook to Python script and run
jupyter nbconvert --to script global_forecasting.ipynb
python global_forecasting.py
```

## Data Directory

The `data/` subdirectory is used for caching downloaded OWID data to speed up subsequent runs. This directory is ignored by git (via .gitignore) to avoid committing large CSV files.

### Network Issues

If you encounter network connectivity errors when running the notebooks:

1. **Download data manually**: Visit https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv and save to `data/owid-covid-data.csv`

2. **Use the helper script** (when you have internet):
   ```bash
   python download_data.py
   ```

3. **Check the data README**: See `data/README.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps

The dynasir package will automatically use local data if available when network downloads fail.

## Planned Examples

Future notebooks to be added:

- **Regional Comparison** (`regional_comparison.ipynb`): Compare forecast performance across different countries
- **Alternative Models** (`alternative_forecasters.ipynb`): Using SARIMAX and other time series models
- **Custom Analysis** (`custom_analysis.ipynb`): Building custom analysis pipelines
- **Visualization Guide** (`visualization_guide.ipynb`): Advanced plotting and interpretation

## Contributing Examples

If you've created an interesting analysis using dynasir, consider contributing it as an example:

1. Ensure your notebook runs from start to finish without errors
2. Add markdown cells explaining the methodology
3. Include interpretation of results
4. Clear all outputs before committing (to keep repository size small)
5. Submit a pull request
