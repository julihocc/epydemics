## 🎨 Development Workflow

### TDD Approach Established ✅
1. **Red Phase:** Write failing tests first
2. **Green Phase:** Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor Phase:** Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **Verify Phase:** Run full test suite to ensure backward compatibility

### Chunk Size Strategy ✅
- Small, verifiable pieces (1-2 hours each)
- Each chunk includes tests + implementation + verification
- Commit points after each successful chunk
- Progress tracking via todo lists

### Quality Gates ✅
- All tests must pass before proceeding
- Backward compatibility must be maintained
- Code must have proper type hints and documentation
- Integration tests validate end-to-end functionality

---

## 🔍 Key Decisions Made

1. **Backward Compatibility First:** Ensured existing code continues to work
2. **TDD Approach:** Tests written before implementation
3. **Gradual Migration:** Extract piece by piece rather than big bang
4. **Type Safety:** Added proper type hints with `typing.Final`
5. **Documentation:** Comprehensive docstrings for all new modules
6. **Import Strategy:** Graceful fallback for partial migration states

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Code Quality:** Type hints, documentation, proper structure
- ✅ **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility:** Existing code continues to work unchanged
- ✅ **Performance:** No regression in execution speed
- ✅ **Maintainability:** Cleaner, more modular code organization

## Next Steps - Phase 2 Ready

With Phase 1 foundation complete (100%), we're ready to tackle the core functionality extraction. The infrastructure is solid and all systems are validated.

**Immediate Phase 2 objectives:**
1. **DataContainer Extraction** - Extract from epydemics.py to data/container.py
2. **Model Class Extraction** - Extract to models/sird.py with VAR implementation  
3. **API Design** - Create new clean interfaces alongside legacy support
4. **Test Coverage Expansion** - Achieve 80%+ coverage on extracted components
5. **Performance Validation** - Ensure no regression in computational performance

**Ready for execution:**
