## Running Tests

We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, first install the development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
```

Then, run `pytest` from the root directory of the project:

```bash
pytest
```

This will automatically discover and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

## Coding Style

We use `black` for code formatting and `flake8` for linting. We also use `mypy` for static type checking. These tools are configured in the `pyproject.toml` file and are enforced by the pre-commit hooks.

Before committing your changes, please make sure to run the pre-commit hooks to ensure your code follows our coding style. You can install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Documentation

We use Sphinx for generating documentation. The documentation is located in the `docs` directory. To build the documentation, first install the documentation dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[docs]"
```

Then, navigate to the `docs` directory and run:

```bash
make html
```

The generated HTML files will be in the `docs/_build/html` directory.
