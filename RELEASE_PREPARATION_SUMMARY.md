## What The Maintainer Needs To Do

### Prerequisites Confirmed
According to the maintainer's comment in the issue:
- [x] Tests: 433/433 passing (100%)
- [x] Code quality: black & isort pass
- [x] Documentation: Complete and accurate
- [x] Notebooks: All 7 validated
- [x] Backward compatibility: Verified

### Release Steps (From RELEASE_GUIDE_v0.11.0.md)

**Step 1**: Merge this branch to main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge copilot/prepare-pypi-release-v0-11-0
git push origin main
```

**Step 2**: Create and push release tag
```bash
git tag -a v0.11.0 -m "Release v0.11.0: PyPI Publication Release"
git push origin v0.11.0
```

**Step 3**: Monitor GitHub Actions
- Release workflow triggers automatically on tag push
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Will run CI tests, build packages, publish to PyPI

**Step 4**: Verify PyPI Publication
```bash
# Check PyPI page
https://pypi.org/project/epydemics/0.11.0/

# Test installation
python -m venv test_env
source test_env/bin/activate
pip install epydemics==0.11.0
python -c "import epydemics; print(epydemics.__version__)"  # Should print: 0.11.0
```

**Step 5**: Create GitHub Release
- Use template in RELEASE_GUIDE_v0.11.0.md
- Copy CHANGELOG.md v0.11.0 section for release notes

## Key Points

### This Is A Consolidation Release
v0.11.0 does not add new features beyond v0.10.0. It is a:
- **Stability release**: All features from v0.10.0 now production-ready
- **PyPI publication release**: First official pip-installable version
- **Quality assurance release**: 100% test pass rate, complete documentation
- **Backward compatible**: No breaking changes from v0.9.1 or v0.10.0

### Changes Are Minimal
Only 3 files changed, totaling 423 lines (mostly documentation):
- CHANGELOG.md: Release notes (required for every release)
- pyproject.toml: 1-line fix for deprecated license format
- RELEASE_GUIDE_v0.11.0.md: Instructions for maintainer (new file)

No code changes, no test changes, no API changes.

### Release Workflow Is Automated
The `.github/workflows/release.yml` handles:
1. Running CI tests (Python 3.9-3.12, code quality)
2. Building packages (wheel + sdist)
3. Creating GitHub Release
4. Publishing to PyPI (via trusted publishing/OIDC)

Maintainer only needs to: merge → tag → push → verify

## Troubleshooting Reference

If the automated release workflow fails, see RELEASE_GUIDE_v0.11.0.md for:
- Common failure scenarios and fixes
- Manual PyPI upload procedures (fallback)
- PyPI trusted publishing setup instructions
- Version conflict resolution

## Success Criteria

After following the release guide, verify:
- [ ] PyPI page exists: https://pypi.org/project/epydemics/0.11.0/
- [ ] `pip install epydemics==0.11.0` works
- [ ] Installed version is 0.11.0
- [ ] Basic imports work: `from epydemics import DataContainer, Model`
- [ ] GitHub Release created with notes
- [ ] Git tag exists: `v0.11.0`

## Questions?

All details are documented in:
- **RELEASE_GUIDE_v0.11.0.md**: Complete release procedures
- **CHANGELOG.md**: User-facing release notes
- **pyproject.toml**: Package metadata and dependencies
- **.github/workflows/release.yml**: Automated release workflow
