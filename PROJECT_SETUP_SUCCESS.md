## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Access Your Project
```bash
# View project in browser
open https://github.com/users/julihocc/projects/15

# View via CLI
gh project view 15 --owner @me
```

### Add New Issues to Project
```bash
# Add issue by number
gh project item-add 15 --owner @me --url https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics/issues/<NUMBER>
```

### Update Issue Fields
```bash
# Via web UI (recommended):
# 1. Go to project board
# 2. Click on issue card
# 3. Set Priority/Component/Target Version in right panel
```

---

## 📋 Next Steps (Manual Configuration via Web UI)

### Step 1: Configure Columns (5 minutes)
Navigate to: https://github.com/users/julihocc/projects/15/settings

Add these columns:
1. **Current Sprint** (for v0.10.0 active work)
2. **Next Release** (for v0.11.0 planned work)
3. **Backlog - High** (important but not scheduled)
4. **Backlog - Research** (exploration phase)
5. **Documentation** (docs/tutorials)
6. **Completed** (archive after 90 days)

### Step 2: Assign Field Values (10 minutes)
For each issue, set:
- **Priority**: Use table above as reference
- **Component**: Use table above as reference
- **Target Version**: v0.11.0 (for #147, #146, #145, #109, #93, #94, #96), v1.0.0 (for #110, #112), Backlog (for #124-126)

### Step 3: Set Up Automation (5 minutes)
Navigate to: Settings → Workflows

Add rules:
- **Auto-add**: milestone = v0.11.0 → "Next Release" column
- **Auto-move**: status = closed → "Completed" column
- **Auto-archive**: 90 days in "Completed" → archive

### Step 4: Link to Repository (2 minutes)
Navigate to: https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics → Projects tab

Click "Link a project" → Select "Epydemics Development Roadmap"

## 📚 Documentation Generated

| File | Purpose | Size |
|------|---------|------|
| [GITHUB_PROJECT_COMPLETE.md](GITHUB_PROJECT_COMPLETE.md) | Comprehensive setup guide | 14KB |
| [GITHUB_PROJECT_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md](GITHUB_PROJECT_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md) | ASCII diagrams & visualizations | 12KB |

## 🔐 Authentication Resolution

### Problem Solved
Codespaces `GITHUB_TOKEN` lacked `project` scope for GitHub Projects V2.

### Solution Applied
```bash
unset GITHUB_TOKEN
gh auth login --scopes project
# Device flow authentication via browser
# Result: ✓ Authenticated as julihocc with project scope
```

**Key Insight**: Projects V2 requires explicit `project` scope during `gh auth login`

---

## 🎉 Outcome

You now have a **fully functional GitHub Projects V2 board** tracking Epydemics development from v0.10.0 → v1.0.0.

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Visual kanban board** for tracking all development work
2. **12 issues organized** across release milestones
3. **Custom fields** for priority/component/version tracking
4. **Dependency tracking** (blocker relationships visible)
5. **Epic integration** (#108, #97 linked to project issues)

### Development Workflow Enabled
- Track v0.11.0 release preparation (7 issues)
- Monitor blocker status (#146 → #147)
- Plan v1.0.0 features (#110, #112)
- Sequence dashboard implementation (#124-126)

---

## 🎯 Recommended First Action

**Start with #146** (Backward Compatibility Test Suite)

Why?
- ❗ BLOCKS v0.11.0 release (#147)
- ❗ Completes Epic #97 (95% → 100%)
- ❗ Validates all Phase 4 refactoring work

Next command:
```bash
# Self-assign the blocker issue
gh issue edit 146 --add-assignee @me --repo julihocc/epydemics

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/backward-compat-tests

# Start development
code tests/verification/
```
