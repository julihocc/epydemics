# Incidence Mode Implementation Progress (Issue #114)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All Components Implemented and Tested  
**Branch**: `meales-integration-phase-2`  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-08  
**Related**: Phase 2 Technical Spec (docs/PHASE_2_TECHNICAL_SPEC_v0.9.0.md)

## Overview

Implementing incidence mode to handle diseases with sporadic case patterns (measles, eliminated diseases) where incident cases can vary up/down rather than monotonically increase.

**Key Innovation**: Flip the traditional epidemiological model:
- **Cumulative Mode** (existing): C is input → derive I = C - R - D
- **Incidence Mode** (NEW): I is input → derive C = cumsum(I)

**Critical Architectural Insight**: Since we forecast **rates** (α, β, γ, δ) rather than compartments, the forecasting and simulation engines work identically for both modes. The mode only affects data interpretation during feature engineering.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed (100% of Issue #114)

1. **Data Validation** (100% complete)
   - `validate_incidence_data()` function created
   - Validates I, D, N columns present
   - Allows I to vary (no monotonicity constraint)
   - Mode parameter added to `validate_data()`

2. **Feature Engineering** (100% complete - commit `fd5a331`)
   - `feature_engineering()` accepts `mode='cumulative'|'incidence'`
   - Created `_calculate_compartments_incidence()` helper
     - I is preserved as input
     - C calculated via `cumsum(I)`
     - R calculated from lagged cumulative I
     - S calculated as `N - C` (or `N - C - V` for SIRDV)
   - Created `_calculate_compartments_cumulative()` helper (refactored existing logic)
   - Rate calculations (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) unified for both modes
   - Full SIRD/SIRDV support

3. **DataContainer Integration** (100% complete)
   - `DataContainer.__init__()` accepts `mode` parameter
   - Passes mode to validation and feature engineering
   - Mode stored as instance attribute
   - Backward compatible (defaults to 'cumulative')

4. **Test Coverage** (100% complete)
   - **21 unit tests** in `test_incidence_mode.py`:
     - Basic incidence mode calculations (I→C, dC=I)
     - SIRD compartment calculations
     - Rate calculations (alpha, beta, gamma, R0)
     - Cumulative vs incidence mode comparison
     - Validation and edge cases
     - SIRDV with vaccination
     - Real-world measles patterns (sporadic outbreaks, elimination/reintroduction)
   - **6 integration tests** in `test_incidence_mode_workflow.py`:
     - DataContainer mode preservation
     - Model mode inheritance
     - Complete E2E workflow (data→model→forecast→simulate→evaluate)
     - Feature engineering validation
     - Measles realistic patterns
   - **All 322 fast tests passing** (316 + 6 new integration tests)
   - Zero regressions

5. **Model API Updates** (100% complete - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
   - Model class inherits mode from DataContainer automatically (line 203 in sird.py)
   - Mode propagates throughout entire pipeline
   - No additional code needed - architecture supports both modes transparently

6. **Forecasting Updates** (100% complete - NO CHANGES NEEDED)
   - **Key Insight**: Forecaster forecasts **rates** (α, β, γ, δ), not compartments
   - Rates are calculated identically for both cumulative and incidence modes
   - VARForecaster, Prophet, ARIMA backends all work without modification
   - Confidence intervals generated correctly for both modes

7. **Simulation Updates** (100% complete - NO CHANGES NEEDED)
   - **Key Insight**: Simulation uses compartment identity C = I + R + D
   - This identity holds regardless of which compartment was input
   - EpidemicSimulation generates 27 scenarios (SIRD) or 81 scenarios (SIRDV) correctly
   - All simulation logic mode-independent

8. **Integration Testing** (100% complete)
   - E2E tests with realistic incidence data patterns
   - Complete workflow validated: data→model→forecast→simulate→evaluate
   - Measles outbreak patterns tested (sporadic cases, elimination, reintroduction)
   - All edge cases covered

## Architectural Decisions

### Why No Forecasting/Simulation Changes Were Needed

The implementation turned out to be simpler than initially anticipated due to a key architectural insight:

**We forecast rates, not compartments.**

The forecasting engine (VAR/Prophet/ARIMA) forecasts the time-varying epidemiological rates:
- α(t): infection rate
- β(t): recovery rate  
- γ(t): mortality rate
- δ(t): vaccination rate (SIRDV only)

These rates are calculated identically regardless of mode:
- **Cumulative mode**: Rates calculated from C → I (derived) → α, β, γ, δ
- **Incidence mode**: Rates calculated from I (input) → C (derived) → α, β, γ, δ

Once we have the rates, the simulation uses the fundamental SIRD compartment identities:
```
C = I + R + D  (always true, regardless of which was input)
S = N - C      (SIRD)
S = N - C - V  (SIRDV)
```

These identities are **mode-independent**. The simulation doesn't care whether C came from input or was derived from cumsum(I).

### Data Flow Comparison

**Cumulative Mode:**
```
Input: C (monotonic) → Derive: I = dC → Rates: α,β,γ,δ → Forecast rates → Simulate compartments
```

**Incidence Mode:**
```
Input: I (can vary) → Derive: C = cumsum(I) → Rates: α,β,γ,δ → Forecast rates → Simulate compartments
```

**Common Path:** Both modes converge at "Rates: α,β,γ,δ" and share all downstream logic.

## Implementation Details

### Feature Engineering

The only code that needed modification was feature engineering. We created two separate compartment calculation functions:

```python
def _calculate_compartments_incidence(data, has_vaccination, settings):
    """Calculate SIRD compartments when I is input (incidence mode)."""
    # I is already present (input data)
    
    # C: Cumulative cases
    data['C'] = data['I'].cumsum()
    
    # R: Recovered (lagged cumulative I minus deaths)
    recovered_cumulative = data['I'].shift(settings.RECOVERY_LAG).fillna(0).cumsum()
    data['R'] = (recovered_cumulative - data['D']).clip(lower=0)
    
    # S: Susceptible
    if has_vaccination:
        data['S'] = data['N'] - data['C'] - data['V']  # SIRDV
    else:
        data['S'] = data['N'] - data['C']  # SIRD
    
    # A: At-risk population
    data['A'] = data['S'] + data['I']
    
    # dC = I (incident cases)
    data['dC'] = data['I']
    
    # dC = I (incident cases)
    data['dC'] = data['I']
    
    # Other differences and rates calculated normally
    # (same as cumulative mode)
```

### Mode Propagation

Mode propagates automatically through the pipeline:
1. User specifies mode in DataContainer creation
2. DataContainer stores mode as instance attribute  
3. Model reads `data_container.mode` and stores it
4. All downstream components work identically for both modes

### Test Results Summary

- **Unit tests**: 21 tests in `test_incidence_mode.py` - 100% passing
- **Integration tests**: 6 tests in `test_incidence_mode_workflow.py` - 100% passing
- **Total test suite**: 322 tests passing (316 fast + 6 new integration)
- **Coverage**: Zero regressions, all existing tests still passing

## Real-World Use Case: Mexico Measles

The incidence mode enables modeling of Mexico's measles data:

```python
# Mexico measles annual cases (2010-2019)
I = [220, 55, 667, 164, 81, 34, 0, 0, 12, 4]

# Incidence mode handles:
# - Large outbreak (667 cases in 2012)
# - Elimination periods (0 cases in 2016-2017)
# - Sporadic reintroduction (12 cases in 2018)
# - Non-monotonic pattern (up/down variation)
```

Traditional cumulative mode **cannot** model this pattern because C must always increase.

## Summary

**Implementation Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

The incidence mode feature is fully implemented and tested. The key architectural insight that made this possible is that we forecast **rates** rather than **compartments**, making the forecasting and simulation logic naturally mode-independent.

**What was done:**
- Feature engineering modified to support dual modes
- 21 unit tests added for incidence mode calculations
- 6 integration tests added for E2E workflow validation
- Documentation updated (docstrings, type hints, examples)
- Zero breaking changes - 100% backward compatible

**What was NOT needed:**
- No forecasting code changes (we forecast rates, not compartments)
- No simulation code changes (compartment identities are mode-independent)
- No Model API changes (mode inheritance already implemented)

**Next Steps for v0.9.0 Release:**
1. Update example notebook 07 with realistic measles workflow
2. Add measles-specific documentation to USER_GUIDE.md
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with incidence mode feature
4. Consider adding helper function for common incidence patterns
