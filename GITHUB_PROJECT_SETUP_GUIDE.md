## Step 5: Create Views (Optional)

GitHub Projects allows multiple views of the same board:

### View 1: Priority View
- Group by: **Priority label** (high-priority, medium, low)
- Sort by: Creation date

### View 2: Milestone View
- Group by: **Milestone** (v0.10.0, v0.11.0, v1.0.0)
- Sort by: Due date

### View 3: Epic View
- Filter by: **Epic** issues only
- Show: Epic parent + child issues

### View 4: Default Status View
- Group by: **Column** (current board layout)
- Sort by: Priority

---

## Step 6: Add Issues to Project

### Batch 1: Next Release (v0.11.0) - Priority
1. Open each issue:
   - #147, #146, #93, #94, #96, #109
2. On the issue page, scroll to "Projects" section
3. Click **"Add to project"**
4. Select **"Epydemics Development Roadmap"**
5. Set column to **"Next Release (v0.11.0)"**

### Batch 2: Backlog - High Priority

### Custom Fields (Optional)

Add custom fields for better tracking:

- **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, In Review, Blocked, Waiting

## Step 8: Share & Maintain

### Share with Team
- Copy project link: https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics/projects/[project-number]
- Add to repository README
- Include in development documentation

### Weekly Maintenance
- **Every Monday**: Move completed issues to "Completed" column
- **Every Monday**: Update issue progress in descriptions
- **Biweekly**: Reassess priorities in "Next Release" column
- **Monthly**: Update epic progress percentages

### Sprint Planning (Biweekly)
- Move issues from "Backlog" to "Next Release" as work begins
- Ensure HIGH priority issues are in Next Release column
- Identify blockers in current sprint

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find Projects tab
- **Solution**: Make sure you're on the repository page, not your profile
- URL should be: https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics

### Issue: Automation not working
- **Solution**: Ensure you have admin/maintain permissions on the repository
- Click **"Settings"** > **"Collaborators"** to check your role

### Issue: Can't add specific issue to project
- **Solution**: Close and reopen the issue page, or refresh the browser
- Ensure the project is public if issue is public

### Issue: Custom fields not appearing
- **Solution**: Custom fields are available in table view only
- Switch to **"Table"** view from the view dropdown
