# All v0.10.0 code works identically in v0.11.0
from epydemics import DataContainer, Model
from epydemics.analysis import ModelReport

# Existing workflows unchanged
container = DataContainer(data, mode='incidence', frequency='YE')

# ... (same API)

# New: Official PyPI installation
# pip install epydemics==0.11.0
```

### Installation

**Official PyPI Release**:
```bash
pip install epydemics==0.11.0
```

## [0.10.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added - Fractional Recovery Lag for Annual Frequency

**Critical Fix: Native Annual Frequency with Incidence Mode**

This release resolves the `LinAlgError` when using annual frequency with incidence mode, enabling modeling of eliminated diseases (measles, polio, rubella) with sporadic outbreak patterns.

**Core Implementation:**
- **Fractional Recovery Lag**: Changed from integer to float
  - Annual frequency: 14 days = 0.0384 years (14/365)
  - Monthly frequency: 14 days = 0.47 months (14/30)
  - Weekly/Daily: Unchanged (already optimal)
- **Linear Interpolation**: Implemented fractional lag shifts using weighted interpolation
  - Formula: `(1-weight) * shift(floor) + weight * shift(ceil)`
  - Applied to both cumulative and incidence modes
- **Automatic Constant Detection**: VAR models detect constant columns (e.g., alpha=1.0)
  - Uses `trend='n'` (no trend) to prevent multicollinearity errors
  - Handles elimination-phase disease patterns gracefully

**Problem Solved:**
- Before: Annual + incidence mode → `LinAlgError` (beta = 1.0 constant → singular covariance matrix)
- After: Beta varies (0.038 to 1.0) → VAR fits successfully → Forecasts work

**Files Changed:**
- `src/epydemics/data/frequency_handlers.py`: Changed `get_recovery_lag()` return type to `float`
- `src/epydemics/data/features.py`: Implemented fractional lag interpolation
- `src/epydemics/models/forecasting/var.py`: Added constant column detection

**Testing:**
- Added 10 comprehensive integration tests in `tests/integration/test_annual_incidence_native.py`
- Updated 51 frequency handler tests for fractional lag expectations
- Test pass rate: 421/423 (99.5%)
- All 6 example notebooks validated

**Notebooks:**
- Deleted obsolete `06_annual_measles_workaround.ipynb` (pre-v0.10.0 workaround)
- Renamed `07_incidence_mode_measles.ipynb` → `06_incidence_mode_measles.ipynb`
- Updated notebook 06 with native annual frequency workflow

**Documentation:**
- `RELEASE_NOTES_v0.10.0.md`: Complete release documentation
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md`: Technical details of fractional lag implementation
- `TESTING_RESULTS.md`: Comprehensive test validation report

### Changed
- Recovery lag return type: `int` → `float` in all frequency handlers
- Monthly recovery lag: 1 month → 0.47 months (more accurate)
- Annual recovery lag: 1 year → 0.0384 years (critical fix)

### Fixed
- `LinAlgError` when using annual frequency with incidence mode (#138)
- Beta rate now varies correctly in annual data (was constant 1.0)
- VAR models handle constant columns without errors

### Migration Notes
**100% Backward Compatible** - No breaking changes. Existing code continues to work.

New capability (optional):
```python
# Old: Would fail with LinAlgError
container = DataContainer(annual_data, mode="incidence")

# New: Works natively
container = DataContainer(annual_data, mode="incidence", frequency="YE")
```

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-13

### Added - Phases 4-7: Native Multi-Frequency Support (COMPLETE)

**Major Feature: Native Multi-Frequency Processing Without Resampling**

The system now processes epidemiological data in its native frequency without artificial resampling. Supports 5 frequency types: Daily (D), Business Day (B), Weekly (W), Monthly (ME), and Annual (YE).

**Phase 4: Frequency-Aware VAR Parameter Defaults**
- Automatic max_lag selection based on frequency:
  - Daily (D): 14 lags (2 weeks)
  - Business Day (B): 10 lags (2 trading weeks)
  - Weekly (W): 8 lags (2 months)
  - Monthly (ME): 6 lags (6 months)
  - Annual (YE): 3 lags (3 years)
- Intelligent max_lag adjustment when data insufficient: `max(1, (n_obs-20)/6)`
- Logging for max_lag adjustments and frequency detection

**Phase 5: Frequency-Aware Forecast Aggregation**
- `Model.aggregate_forecast()` now detects source frequency from forecasted data
- Skips resampling when target frequency matches source (optimization)
- Proper handling of modern pandas frequency aliases (ME, YE)
- Maps deprecated aliases automatically (M→ME, Y→YE)

**Phase 6: Frequency-Aware Seasonal Pattern Detection**
- New `SeasonalPatternDetector` class in `src/epydemics/analysis/seasonality.py`
- Adaptive threshold for periodicity detection (0.3 for frequent, 0.2 for long periods)
- Frequency-specific candidate periods:
  - Daily: 7, 14, 30, 91, 365 days (weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, annual)
  - Weekly: 4, 13, 26, 52 weeks (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
  - Monthly: 3, 6, 12 months (quarterly, semi-annual, annual)
  - Annual: None (insufficient data for patterns)
- ARIMA/Prophet recommendations based on detected seasonality
- 13 comprehensive tests covering all frequencies

**Phase 7: Business Day Frequency Support**
- New `BusinessDayFrequencyHandler` class
  - 252 trading days per year
  - recovery_lag = 10 business days (2 trading weeks)
  - max_lag = 10 (conservative for VAR)
  - min_observations = 60 (3 months of trading data)
- Extended frequency detection to recognize 'B' code
- Business day pattern detection (1-day gaps with weekend skips)
- DataContainer accepts 'B' in frequency validation
- 12 comprehensive tests for business day support

**System Integration:**
- Pluggable `FrequencyHandler` architecture with concrete implementations
- `FrequencyHandlerRegistry` for handler lookup
- Frequency detection in `DataContainer.__init__()`
- Automatic frequency propagation through pipeline
- Zero breaking changes - fully backward compatible

**Testing:**
- 394 tests passing (32 skipped for optional dependencies)
- +12 new tests for business day support
- +13 new tests for seasonal pattern detection
- All phases validated with comprehensive test coverage

- `PHASE_7_SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Development walkthrough
- `PHASE_7_FILE_INDEX.md` - Quick reference guide

### Added - Phase 2: Incidence Mode (Measles Integration Complete)

### Added - Phase 2: Incidence Mode (Measles Integration Complete)

**Major Feature: Incidence Mode Support**
- **Dual-Mode Data Support** - Handle both cumulative and incidence data patterns
  - **Cumulative mode** (default): C (cumulative cases) as input, I derived from dC
  - **Incidence mode** (NEW): I (incident cases) as input, C derived from cumsum(I)
  - Mode automatically propagates through entire pipeline (DataContainer → Model → Forecast → Simulation)
  - Both modes use identical forecasting and simulation engines (rates-based architecture)

**Key Architectural Insight**
- System forecasts **rates** (α, β, γ, δ), not compartments (C, I, R, D)
- Rate calculations identical for both modes after feature engineering
- No forecasting or simulation code changes needed - naturally mode-independent
- C = I + R + D identity holds regardless of which compartment was input

**Implementation Details:**
- `validate_incidence_data()` - Validates I, D, N columns, allows I to vary (no monotonicity)
- `_calculate_compartments_incidence()` - Incidence-specific compartment calculations
  - I preserved as input
  - C calculated via cumsum(I)
  - R calculated from lagged cumulative I
  - S calculated as N - C (SIRD) or N - C - V (SIRDV)
- `_calculate_compartments_cumulative()` - Refactored existing cumulative logic
- Mode parameter added to `DataContainer.__init__()`, `validate_data()`, `feature_engineering()`
- Model inherits mode from DataContainer automatically (line 203 in sird.py)

**Real-World Use Cases Enabled:**
- **Measles surveillance**: Annual incident cases with sporadic outbreaks
  - Example: Mexico 2010-2024 [220, 55, 667, 164, 81, 34, 12, 0, 0, 4, 18, 45, 103, 67, 89]
  - Handles elimination periods (0 cases), reintroduction, non-monotonic patterns
- **Eliminated diseases**: Polio, rubella with variable annual incidence
- **Outbreak patterns**: Non-monotonic case counts (increase → decrease → increase)

**Testing & Quality:**
- **21 new unit tests** (`tests/unit/data/test_incidence_mode.py`)
  - Basic incidence calculations (I→C, dC=I)
  - SIRD/SIRDV compartment calculations
  - Rate calculations (alpha, beta, gamma, R0)
  - Cumulative vs incidence mode comparison
  - Validation and edge cases
  - Real-world measles patterns
- **6 new integration tests** (`tests/integration/test_incidence_mode_workflow.py`)
  - DataContainer mode preservation
  - Model mode inheritance
  - Complete E2E workflow (data→model→forecast→simulate→evaluate)
  - Feature engineering validation
  - Realistic measles patterns
- **Total: 322 tests passing** (316 existing + 27 new)
- **Zero regressions** - 100% backward compatible

**Documentation:**
- `INCIDENCE_MODE_PROGRESS.md` - Comprehensive implementation progress tracking
- `MEASLES_INTEGRATION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Project completion summary
- Updated docstrings in Model class with incidence mode examples
- Example notebook 07: Incidence mode measles workflow

### Changed

**API Enhancements:**
- `DataContainer(data, mode='cumulative'|'incidence')` - NEW mode parameter
  - Default: 'cumulative' (backward compatible)
  - 'incidence': I as input, C derived
  - Mode stored as instance attribute
  
- `Model(data_container)` - Inherits mode from DataContainer
  - `model.mode` property reflects data mode
  - All downstream operations mode-aware
  - No API changes needed - automatic mode propagation

**Internal Improvements:**
- Feature engineering refactored for dual-mode support
- Validation split into cumulative and incidence validators
- Unified rate calculations for both modes
- Enhanced type hints and documentation

### Fixed
- None (new feature, no bug fixes)

### Performance
- **No performance overhead** - identical runtime for both modes
- Test suite: ~28 seconds for 322 fast tests (unchanged)
- Memory footprint: unchanged

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ **100% Backward Compatible**
- Default mode is 'cumulative' (existing behavior)
- All 316 existing tests pass without modification
- No breaking changes to API
- Existing code continues to work unchanged

### Migration Guide
No migration needed - v0.9.0 is fully backward compatible. To use incidence mode:

```python
# Before (cumulative mode - still works)
data = pd.DataFrame({'C': [100, 150, 200], 'D': [1, 2, 3], 'N': [1e6]*3})
container = DataContainer(data)  # mode='cumulative' (default)

# After (incidence mode - new capability)
data = pd.DataFrame({'I': [50, 55, 45], 'D': [1, 2, 3], 'N': [1e6]*3})
container = DataContainer(data, mode='incidence')  # NEW
```

### Known Limitations
- Annual data frequency mismatch warning still applies (Phase 1 workaround)
- Small sample sizes (annual data) require lower lag orders (max_lag=2-3)
- Native frequency support planned for v0.10.0+

### Migration Guide

**From v0.7.0 to v0.8.0:**

All existing code continues to work without changes. New features are opt-in.

**For Annual Data Users:**
```python
# Old approach (would fail or give poor results)
container = DataContainer(annual_data, window=7)  # Not recommended

# New v0.8.0 approach (Phase 1 workaround)
import warnings
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message=".*FREQUENCY MISMATCH.*")
    container = DataContainer(annual_data, window=1)

model = Model(container, start="1982", stop="2010")
model.create_model()
model.fit_model(max_lag=3)
model.forecast(steps=365 * 10)  # 10 years in days
model.run_simulations(n_jobs=1)
model.generate_result()

# Aggregate to annual output
annual_forecast = model.aggregate_forecast(
    "C", target_frequency="Y", aggregate_func="last", methods=["mean", "median"]
)
```

**Looking Ahead to v0.9.0:**
Phase 2 will bring native multi-frequency support:
```python
# Future v0.9.0 API (not available yet)
container = DataContainer(annual_data, frequency='Y', mode='incidence')
model = Model(container, start="1982", stop="2010")
model.forecast(steps=10)  # 10 years natively - no reindexing!
```

### Known Limitations

- Annual data is still reindexed to daily internally (forward-fill creates artifacts)
- Temporal aggregation is a workaround, not a true solution
- Annual workflow not recommended for production critical decisions
- Suitable for exploratory analysis and validation
- Native annual support planned for v0.9.0 (Q1 2026)

### Performance

- No performance regression on existing workflows
- Temporal aggregation adds < 100ms overhead
- Frequency detection is O(1) for typical datasets
- All optimizations from v0.7.0 maintained (parallel simulations, caching)

### Related Issues

- Closes #99: Implement frequency detection and warnings for annual data
- Closes #100: Add temporal aggregation to Model.forecast()
- Closes #101: Create USER_GUIDE.md and update documentation
- Closes #102: Create example notebook: Annual Measles Data Workaround
- Completes #98: [EPIC] Phase 1: Quick Wins - Measles Integration Support
