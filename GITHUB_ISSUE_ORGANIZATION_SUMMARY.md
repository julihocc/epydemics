**Date**: December 2025  
**Repository**: julihocc/epydemics  
**Status**: ✅ Planning Complete - Ready for Manual Execution

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Issue Retrieval and Analysis
- Retrieved all 131 GitHub issues (15 open, 116 closed)
- Analyzed issue categories, epics, and completion status
- Verified scenario analysis features in codebase

### 2. ✅ Epic Updates
Successfully updated two major epics with current status:

- **Epic #108** (Phase 3 Advanced Features): Updated to show 25% complete
  - ✅ Scenario analysis complete (v0.9.1)
  - ❌ Outbreak metrics, probabilistic forecasting, coverage-based SIRDV remaining
  
- **Epic #97** (Multi-Backend Refactoring): Updated to show 95% complete
  - ✅ Phases 1-3 complete (abstraction layer, integration, new backends)
  - ⏳ Phase 4 testing/documentation nearly complete

### 3. ✅ New Issue Proposals Created
Generated 3 comprehensive issue drafts in `PROPOSED_ISSUES_v0.11.0.md`:

- **Issue #144**: v0.11.0 PyPI Release Preparation (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Full release checklist with 20+ tasks
  - Documentation, testing, packaging requirements
  - Timeline: January 2026

- **Issue #145**: Performance Benchmarking & Profiling Suite (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
  - Comprehensive benchmarking framework
  - Multi-frequency performance validation
  - Memory profiling and parallel speedup analysis

- **Issue #146**: Backward Compatibility Test Suite (HIGH PRIORITY - BLOCKER)
  - v0.7.0 reference data generation
  - 10+ compatibility tests
  - Required before v0.11.0 release

### 4. ✅ GitHub Project Organization Plan
Created comprehensive project structure in `GITHUB_PROJECT_PLAN.md`:

**6 Swim Lanes Defined**:
1. Current Sprint (v0.10.0) - Active development
2. Next Release (v0.11.0) - 8-12 prioritized issues
3. Backlog - High Priority - 8-10 features for v1.0.0
4. Backlog - Research & Exploration - 5-10 experimental items
5. Documentation - Ongoing doc improvements
6. Completed (Archive) - Last 20-30 closed issues

**Key Features**:
- Priority matrix (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Dependency graph for v0.11.0
- Automation rules for issue management
- Maintenance schedule (weekly/biweekly/quarterly)
- Success metrics (velocity, cycle time, milestone progress)

### 5. ✅ Issue Triage Results

**Issues Verified as Complete**:
- #111, #120-122: Scenario analysis (code verified in codebase)

**Issues Needing Review**:
- #63-73: November 2025 priority block (11 issues)
  - API consistency, R0 methods, visualization, test coverage, documentation
  - Performance optimization, error handling, configuration, logging, type hints
  - Each requires individual assessment in future session

## What Needs Manual Action

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Create 3 New Issues
Use the content from `PROPOSED_ISSUES_v0.11.0.md`:

1. Go to https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics/issues/new
2. Create Issue #144: v0.11.0 PyPI Release Preparation
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `documentation`, `release`
   - Milestone: v0.11.0
3. Create Issue #145: Performance Benchmarking Suite
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `performance`
   - Milestone: v1.0.0
4. Create Issue #146: Backward Compatibility Tests
   - Labels: `testing`, `high-priority`
   - Milestone: v0.11.0

#### 2. Create GitHub Project Board
Follow instructions in `GITHUB_PROJECT_PLAN.md`:

1. Visit https://github.com/julihocc/epydemics/projects
2. Click "New project" → Select "Board" template
3. Name: "Epydemics Development Roadmap"
4. Create 6 columns (Current Sprint, Next Release, Backlog High, Backlog Research, Documentation, Completed)
5. Configure automation rules as specified in plan
6. Populate with issues per categorization

#### 3. Create/Update Milestones
Ensure these milestones exist:
- v0.10.0 (Current - Due: December 2025)
- v0.11.0 (Next - Due: January 2026)
- v1.0.0 (Future - Due: Q2 2026)

#### 4. Apply Labels
Create standard labels if they don't exist:
- Priority: `priority-high`, `priority-medium`, `priority-low`
- Type: `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `testing`, `performance`, `release`
- Epic: `epic`, `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4`
- Status: `in-progress`, `blocked`, `needs-review`, `stale`

#### 5. Review Issues #63-73
Dedicate a future session to individually assess:
- Which are resolved by recent work (e.g., #66 test coverage now 99.5%)
- Which need conversion to concrete tasks
- Which should be closed as out-of-scope

3. Apply appropriate labels and milestones

### Phase 2: Project Board Setup (1 hour)
1. Create GitHub Project board
2. Configure 6 swim lanes with automation
3. Add ~30 issues to appropriate columns
4. Set up custom views (Priority, Milestone, Epic)

### Phase 3: Issue Review Session (2-3 hours)
1. Systematically review issues #63-73
2. Close resolved issues with verification notes
3. Update stale issues or convert to concrete tasks
4. Move issues to project board columns

### Phase 4: Documentation Sync (1 hour)

## Key Decisions Made

### Issue Organization Philosophy
- **Actionable over aspirational**: Issues must have clear acceptance criteria
- **Prioritize by impact**: HIGH = blockers for next release, MEDIUM = important but not blocking, LOW = nice-to-have
- **Time-boxed sprints**: v0.11.0 target is January 2026 (1 month), must be realistic
- **Epic tracking**: Use parent issues (#97, #103, #108) to track multi-issue initiatives

### Project Board Design
- **6 columns** balances detail with simplicity (not too many, not too few)
- **Auto-archive after 90 days** keeps "Completed" column manageable
- **Milestone-based automation** reduces manual triaging
- **Custom views** enable different stakeholder perspectives

### Priority Assignments
**v0.11.0 HIGH PRIORITY** (Must Have):
- #144: Release preparation
- #146: Backward compatibility tests
- #93: Compatibility test implementation

**v0.11.0 MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Should Have):
- #94: CLAUDE.md update
- #96: Dependency review
- #109: Outbreak metrics

**v1.0.0 or Later** (Nice to Have):
- #110: Probabilistic forecasting
- #112: Coverage-based SIRDV
- #145: Performance benchmarking

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic retrieval**: Paginated API calls captured all 131 issues
2. **Codebase verification**: grep_search confirmed scenario analysis implementation
3. **Comprehensive planning**: Project board structure addresses all stakeholder needs
4. **Actionable documentation**: All outputs are ready for immediate execution

### Challenges Encountered
1. **API tool disabled**: Could not create new issues via automation
   - **Solution**: Generated complete templates for manual creation
2. **Large issue count**: 131 issues required prioritization framework
   - **Solution**: Created priority matrix and categorization system
3. **Stale issues**: 11 priority issues from November need review
   - **Solution**: Documented need for dedicated review session

### Recommendations for Future
1. **Regular triage**: Review issues weekly to prevent backlog accumulation
2. **Clear templates**: Require acceptance criteria for all new issues
3. **Epic tracking**: Update epic progress monthly, not just at milestones
4. **Project board**: Use as single source of truth for development status
